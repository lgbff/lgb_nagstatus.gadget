2008-06-29/V1.5.0/jouko@markkanen.net
        Visual layout implementation modified and fixed some bugs.
        
        Gadget and flyout now recognize hosts and services that are on
        scheduled downtime and displays their stats in blue like the
        acknowledged hosts and services. The flyout flags hosts/services with
        scheduled downtime with [SCHED].
        
        If you are using cron (or similar) to run nagxmlstatus.cgi and save
        results to file, you must modify the commandline to contain also
        scheduled_downtime_depth element. See README.txt for correct
        commandline (there was also a typo previously in that commandline
        spec, that has now been fixed).
        
        Gadget now shows a visual alert (blinks red glow around the gadget for
        a few seconds and optionally plays a sound if one is specified in the
        settings) if a host's or service's state has changed since last check.
        Note that the alert is shown/played on all state transitions.
        
        The date and time of latest state change is displayed on the flyout.
        
        And to support the above changes, the nagxmlstatus.cgi adds a
        <last_state_change> element to <program> node that contains the
        timestamp of the last state change in all hosts/services.
        
        The settings page has been revamped. You no longer need to specify the
        URL to Nagios' extinfo.cgi. Instead, you must specify the Nagios Web UI
        root URL, all other URL's are derived from that (including URL to XML
        status provider, if you have placed it under Nagios' cgi-bin directory;
        otherwise you still have an option to set it by hand). Flyout's
        "Nagios Status" headline acts as a link to this URL.
        
2008-06-18/V1.4.3/jouko@markkanen.net
        Fixed a bug in Nagios V3->V2 status.dat conversion, now nagxmlstatus.cgi
        should really work with Nagios V3.
        No changes in gadget.
        
2008-06-16/V1.4.2/jouko@markkanen.net
        Kludged nagxmlstatus.cgi to produce compatible output with Nagios V3
        status.dat file format. Thanks to Paolo Cozzi for testing it!
        
2008-06-16/V1.4.1/jouko@markkanen.net
        Cleaned up flyout layout a bit.
        
        Also gadget itself now recognizes acknowledgement state of hosts and
        services. Error counters are displayed in blue for acknowledged
        services, and status bar show them as blue. Error counters are displayed
        as red/orange/yellow when there are at least 1 error state that has not
        been acknowledged.
        
        Fixed a bug in nagxmlstatus.cgi that caused it to error if run on
        commandline without -f parameter.
        
2008-05-20/V1.4.0/jouko@markkanen.net
        Modifications to nagxmlstatus.cgi:
        * The script takes additional values for parameters:
          node=all returns all nodes (objects) in status.dat
          elem=all returns all elements (values) in status.dat
        * The script can be run on commandline, with parameters
          -n and -e that specify list of nodes and elemets to be returned
          (respectively). The parameters take comma separated list as
          values.
        
        Modifications to the flyout page:
        * The top row displays the date/time when Nagios was started as well
          as date/time when last check command was run.
        * Hosts that have problems, but all problems have been acknowledged,
          are now listed in the right column ("All OK"), on top of the list.
        * Hosts/services that have problems but have been acknowledged
          display a [ACK] tag before host/service name.
        * All hosts/services that have problems now display the plugin output
          and date/time of last state change.
        
        New setting:
        * On settings page there is new setting: URL points to Script/File.
          The File choice is for a setup where the gadget reads a static
          file produced by a commandline nagxmlstatus.cgi.

2008-05-15/V1.3.0/jouko@markkanen.net
        nagxmlstatus.cgi now uses XML::LibXML instead of XML::DOM.
        It is available as perl-XML-LibXML (rpm-based) and libxml-perl
        (Debian based) package on most Linux distributions. This is due
        to that I ran into claims that XML::DOM is nowadays unsupported.
        The script provides exactly the same behaviour as the previous
        version, so current gadget runs fine even with older script.
        
        Status XML request behaviour is changed. The gadget now requests
        new status at intervals specified on settings page. After receiving
        new status XML it updates the gadget and also flyout (if it is
        shown). When showing the flyout, the gadget does not request new
        status XML, but renders the flyout based on cached status XML.
        
2008-05-13/V1.2.2/jouko@markkanen.net
        Added error handling
        * HTTP request timeouts after 30 seconds and displays an error
          message (for both gadget and flyout).
          
2008-05-12/V1.2.1/jouko@markkanen.net
        Modified visual layout:
        * Restructured the flyout xslt template for easier maintenance
          (and removed 40% of the code)
        * Changed the dull one-color dots on the flyout to a bit nicer
          looking ones
        * Modified text/image placings
        

2008-05-09/V1.2.0/jouko@markkanen.net
        Added some checks:
        * Gadget refresh interval defaults to 60 seconds, and the setting
          is accepted only if it is a positive integer.
        * An error message is displayed if XML Provider URL is not set
        * An error message is displayed if XML Provider HTTP request
          returns non-OK status code (ie. not 200 OK)
        
        New features:
        * Gadget has now settings for username and password. These are
          used for HTTP authentication when requesting XML status. XML
          provider script does not ask for authentication itself, but
          you may use .htaccess or similar method on HTTP server to
          require authentication. (Easy setup: place the script in
          Nagios Web UI's cgi-bin directory, and use the same user/pass
          as for logging in Nagios itself)
          
        Fixes:
        * Cleaned some commented-out testing code from XML provider script.

2008-05-07/V1.1.0/jouko@markkanen.net
        Increased some robustness:
        * XML provider script now issues correct cache expiry headers,
          so gadget does not use the bogus random field in URL anymore.
        * XML provider script defaults now to empty root node in XML
          document. Gadget is modified accordingly to request all needed
          elements. Thus the XML provider script is incompatible with
          older versions of the gadget.
          This modification also reduced the XML provider scipt's run
          time and CPU usage by about 50%.
        * XML provider script now returns 500 Internal Server Error, if
          the Nagios status.dat file cannot be opened.

        New/modified features:
        * The flyout can be hidden by clicking on the gadget.
        * The flyout layout is changed so that left column lists all hosts
          (with services) that have non-OK state (either host or service)
          and the right column lists all hosts (with services) that are
          all OK.
        * Host and service names on the flyout are links to corresponding
          Nagios Extended Info page, and the Setting for Nagios Web UI
          URL is renamed to Nagios Extended Info URL. This setting must
          be set point to the extinfo.cgi of Nagios.

2008-05-04/V1.0.0/jouko@markkanen.net
	Initial release. Contains following features:
	* Gadget shows Number of Hosts OK/Unreachable/Down and Services
	  OK/Warning/Critical/Unknown as numbers as well as percentage 
	  bar (each status has different colors). Optionally a user
	  configured title is shown at the top of the gadget.
	* Settings window to configure Gadget Window Title, source URL
	  for XML formatted Nagios status, Nagios Web UI URL (which is 
	  not actually used in this release) and refresh interval.
	* A click on the gadget shows a flyout with more details. The
	  flyout displays total number of hosts and services and lists
	  of hosts and services with non-OK status. Each host/service 
	  is displayed with a colored light indicating it's status and
	  the plugin output for the last check.
	
	Known bugs/issues in this release, as well as planned future
	features:
	* The bars show mostly green in normal situations where there's
	  just a single or few failed hosts/services. I'm planning on
	  adding a overall status indicator that shows green in a 100%
	  OK situation, otherwise it displays color indicating the most
	  severe condition (red for critical service/host down, orange 
	  for host warning).
